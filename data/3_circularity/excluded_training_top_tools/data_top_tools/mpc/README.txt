Benign variants were not available form ExAC variant files.

Hence, we filtered those variants with missense consequences and AF > 0.01. Additionally we selected vairants with PASS

At the end, we were left with around half of variants reported in the paper, so the benign set doesn't entirely match the one used by the authors.
